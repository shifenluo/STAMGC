STAMGC: A Dual-Contrastive Learning Framework for Spatial Domain Identification in Spatial Transcriptomics

In this study, we propose STAMGC, a dual-contrastive learning approach based on graph convolutional networks. This method jointly optimizes the model through regional and topological contrastive learning to process ST data, effectively reducing domain noise and enhancing detailed features. Moreover, this study is the first to apply Gaussian smoothing from the image processing field to ST data, providing a novel perspective to address the spatial discontinuity of gene expression signals.
